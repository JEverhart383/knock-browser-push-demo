# Browser push notifcations in Node.js

This repo contains the example code from a blog post on the Knock blog about [sending browser push notifcations in Node.js](https://knock.app/blog/how-to-send-browser-push-notifications-from-nodejs). You can find additonal details in that post.

This demo app uses Express and [Node Push Notifications](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pushnotifications) to send browser push notifications without an external service.

You will need to generate your own set of [VAPID key](https://vapidkeys.com/) to send push notifications.
